# Basil CSS

### A simple and lightweight CSS framework for building custom user interfaces.

## How to use

0) Run `npm install basilcss` or `yarn add basilcss` in your project directory.
1) Go to your root file for example `main.jsx` and write `import 'basilcss'` on top of your file.
2) Start styling your project.

If you have a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS project just add this line in your `<head>` HTML tag above your root css file: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/basilcss@1.1.2/basil.css">` Make sure it's above so you can overwrite and spice up your styles as you develop your project.

### Like so:
```
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/basilcss@latest/basil.css">
// make sure it's above the main css file
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles/main.css">
</head>
```
